# EMSynConn
One algorithm to detect synaptic location AND connectivity, both dyadic and polyadic.

This is the implementation of the paper: Detecting Synapse Location and Connectivity by Signed Proximity Estimation and Pruning with Deep Nets by Parag et.al., https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02739

The code is built upon those of the Harvard VCG lab https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/code-data.

The synaptic_partner.cpp is called from the generate_proposals.py, to compile it one may need to clone the Neuroproof_minimal repo (or copy the files that is required). https://github.com/paragt/Neuroproof_minimal
